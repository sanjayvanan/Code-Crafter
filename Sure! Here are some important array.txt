Sure! Here are some important array-related problems that you can practice to enhance your problem-solving skills and prepare for software engineering interviews:

1. Two Sum: Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

2. Maximum Subarray: Find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) that has the largest sum and return its sum.

3. Product of Array Except Self: Given an array `nums`, return an array `output` such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

4. Rotate Array: Rotate an array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

5. Contains Duplicate: Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates.

6. Missing Number: Given an array containing `n` distinct numbers taken from `0, 1, 2, ..., n`, find the one that is missing from the array.

7. Merge Intervals: Given a collection of intervals, merge overlapping intervals.

8. Move Zeroes: Given an array `nums`, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

9. Pascal's Triangle: Generate the first `numRows` of Pascal's triangle.

10. Valid Sudoku: Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid.

11. Trapping Rain Water: Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

12. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock: Given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on day `i`, find the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling one share of the stock.

13. Next Permutation: Implement the next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

14. Container With Most Water: Given `n` non-negative integers `a1, a2, ..., an`, where each represents a point at a coordinate `(i, ai)`, `n` vertical lines are drawn. Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis, forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

15. Set Matrix Zeroes: Given an `m x n` matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0.

These are just some examples of important array-related problems that you may encounter in interviews and competitive programming. Solving these problems will not only help you become proficient in working with arrays but also improve your problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.
